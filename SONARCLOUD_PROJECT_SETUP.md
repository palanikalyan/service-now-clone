# üìä HOW TO VIEW YOUR SONARCLOUD PROJECT

## üîç CHECK IF PROJECT EXISTS ON SONARCLOUD

### Step 1: Go to SonarCloud
- URL: https://sonarcloud.io
- Login with your GitHub account

### Step 2: View Your Projects
1. Click your profile icon (top right)
2. Select: **My Projects**
3. Look for: **service-now-clone**

## ‚ùì IF YOU DON'T SEE THE PROJECT

The project might not be created yet. Here's why:

### Reason 1: Project Not Created
- SonarCloud only shows projects you've explicitly created
- The first analysis doesn't auto-create the project

**Solution:** Create it manually:
1. Go to: https://sonarcloud.io
2. Click: **Analyze new project**
3. Select: **palanikalyan/service-now-clone** (your GitHub repo)
4. Click: **Create project**

### Reason 2: Not in Organization
- Your project needs to be in your organization

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://sonarcloud.io/organizations
2. Create/select: **palanikalyan** organization
3. Then analyze the project under that org

## ‚úÖ AFTER PROJECT EXISTS

Once project is created, the workflow will:

1. ‚úÖ Build with Maven
2. ‚úÖ Run analysis
3. ‚úÖ Send results to SonarCloud
4. ‚úÖ Update dashboard automatically
